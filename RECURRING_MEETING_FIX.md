# Recurring Meeting Fix - Guide

## ðŸ”„ **Understanding the Recurring Meeting Issue**

### **Problem:**
- Meeting ID: `86803353253` is a **recurring meeting**
- Recurring meetings have multiple occurrences (7 times until Aug 3, 2025)
- Each occurrence has its own `occurrence_id`
- Registration must be done for specific occurrence, not the main meeting

### **Solution Applied:**
- Updated `registerStudent()` function to detect recurring meetings
- Automatically finds the next upcoming occurrence
- Registers students for the correct occurrence using `occurrence_id`

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now**

### **For Regular Meetings:**
```
Registration URL: meetings/{meetingId}/registrants
Example: meetings/86803353253/registrants
```

### **For Recurring Meetings:**
```
Registration URL: meetings/{meetingId}/registrants?occurrence_id={occurrenceId}
Example: meetings/86803353253/registrants?occurrence_id=1627891200000
```

### **Meeting Type Detection:**
- **Type 8**: Recurring meeting (fixed time)
- **Type 1**: Instant meeting
- **Type 2**: Scheduled meeting
- **Type 3**: Recurring meeting (no fixed time)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Fix**

1. **Try registering a student again** with meeting ID: `86803353253`
2. **Check logs** at `logs/zoom_api_debug.log` for detailed API calls
3. **Expected behavior**: Registration should now work for the next occurrence

### **Debug Information to Check:**
- Meeting type detection
- Occurrence ID selection
