# Database Query Test - Branch â†’ Course â†’ Batch Workflow

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Fixed Queries**

Based on your sample data, here are the working queries:

### **Sample Data Analysis:**
- **Branch Codes**: B-01, B-02, B-03, B-04
- **Courses for B-01**: 10- ICSE, DCET-25, 10- State, I-PU, II-PU, KCET-25, JEE-MAIN, NEET-25
- **Batches for 10- ICSE + B-01**: 10th ICSE Evening Batch, 10th ICSE Morning Batch

### **Query 1: Get Courses by Branch**
```sql
-- Example for branch B-01
SELECT DISTINCT course 
FROM student_details 
WHERE branch = 'B-01' AND status = 1 
ORDER BY course;
```

**Expected Results for B-01:**
- 10- ICSE
- 10- State
- DCET-25
- I-PU
- II-PU
- JEE-MAIN
- KCET-25
- NEET-25

### **Query 2: Get Batches by Course and Branch**
```sql
-- Example for course "10- ICSE" and branch "B-01"
SELECT DISTINCT batch 
FROM student_details 
WHERE course = '10- ICSE' AND branch = 'B-01' AND status = 1 
ORDER BY batch;
```

**Expected Results for 10- ICSE + B-01:**
- 10th ICSE Evening Batch
- 10th ICSE Morning Batch

## âœ… **Fixes Applied:**

1. **Branch Dropdown**: Now shows "B-01 - Main Branch 01 (Laggere)" format
2. **Course Query**: Uses branch_code (B-01) to match student_details.branch
3. **Batch Query**: Filters by both course and branch_code
4. **Ordering**: Added ORDER BY clauses for better user experience
5. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and validation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Workflow:**

1. **User selects "B-01 - Main Branch 01 (Laggere)"**
   - Sends "B-01" to fetch_course_by_branch.php
   - Returns 8 distinct courses

2. **User selects "10- ICSE"**  
   - Sends course="10- ICSE" and branch="B-01" to fetch_batch_by_course.php
   - Returns 2 distinct batches

3. **User selects "10th ICSE Evening Batch"**
   - Form ready for submission with all three selections

The issue should now be resolved!
